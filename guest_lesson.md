# React Router

React router allows you to map URLS to non-physical destinations. When you create a single-page site within a javascript frameworks, the user will expect it to work as they would expect any other multi-page site might: when you click a link, the page changes, and your URL changes. You also want to be able to walk through your browser history properly, pressing back, or forward and ending up exactly where you were.
